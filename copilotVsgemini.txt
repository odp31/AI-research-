Create a Budget Plan 
Gemini: 
Prompt: “Create a budget plan for the next quarter.” 
Result: “I don’t see any tasks about budget, income, or expense for the next quarter.” 
Gemini tried integrating with Google Workspace without consulting the user first and was therefore unable to find relevant information to make the budget. That said, it required more prompting to direct Gemini, making Copilot the better choice in this situation.  
Copilot 
Prompt: “Create a budget plan for the next quarter.” 
Result: Copilot generated a quarterly budget plan that consisted of categories income, fixed expenses, variable expenses, savings and investments, and summary. All the categories were populated with more specific fund allocations and included equations to guide the user in developing an actual budget.  
Write a Blog Post 
Gemini  
Prompt: “Write a blog post about the benefits of remote work.” 
Result: “Remote work offers flexibility, reduces commute time, and increases productivity. Employees can work from anywhere, leading to a better work-life balance.”  
Copilot 
Prompt: “Write a blog post about the benefits of remote work.” 
Result: “Remote work provides numerous benefits, including flexibility, reduced commute time, and increased productivity. Employees can work from anywhere, which enhances work-life balance. Detailed sections and formatting included in Word.  
This was the only prompt/response analysis I felt was similar enough to disregard. While Copilot’s was a bit longer, both offered detailed descriptions of the benefits of remote work. I felt the discrepancy in length was the only difference and was therefore not strong enough to give either software a stronger case.  
 

 

 

Create a To-Do List 
Gemini 
Prompt: “Create a to-do list for today.” 
Result: “Alright, I created a reminder titled ‘To-do list for today.’  
Google tasks: to-do list for today (empty) 
Copilot 
Prompt: “Create a to-do list for today.” 
Result: 
Morning Routine 
Wake up and freshen up  
Have breakfast 
Exercise or stretch 
Work/Study Tasks 
Check and respond to emails 
Attend any scheduled meetings or classes  
Complete project/task 1

Code Generation  
Gemini  
Prompt: “Generate a Python code snippet to read a CSV file.” 
Result: 
import CSV 
def read_csv_file(file_path) 
 
“”” Reads a CSV file and returns its contents as a list of lists.”” 
 
with open(file_path, ‘r’) as file: 
reader = csv.reader(file) 
data = list(reader) 
return data 
 
# example usage  
file_path = ‘your_file.csv’ # replace with your actual file 	path  
data = read_csv_file(file_path) 
 
# print first 5 rows of data  
for row in data[:5]: 
print(row)  
Code is unclear and hard to follow; is more complicated than it needs to be  
Copilot 
Prompt: “Generate a Python code snippet to read a CSV file.” 
Result: 
import pandas as pd 
file_path = ‘your_file.csv’ 
data = pd.read_csv(file_path) 
print(data.head()) 
   
To run this code, make sure you have the pandas library 		installed; you can install it using pip: 
 
pip install pandas 
If you need any more help with this, feel free to ask!  
 
Code is clearer and easier to follow than Gemini’s; comments are better organized and easier to understand. 
Gemini’s also had awkward spaces where some of the code was hard to see  
Image Generation  
Gemini 
Prompt: “Generate an image of an owl.” 
Result: 
 
Copilot 
Prompt: “Generate an image of an owl.” 
Result:  
 
I would also like to note that upon integrating Copilot with Microsoft Edge, Microsoft’s browser, users are given the choice between 3 
different “versions” of Copilot- precise, balanced and creative. It also allows users to choose where the information is coming from; 
the general internet or the web page open while searching.   
 

SUMMARY 
In conclusion, from my findings, I believe Microsoft’s Copilot is the better software to be used. I say this because it is better 
integrated with Microsoft 365 than Gemini is with Google workspace. 

Tasks were easier to have done in office tools in Copilot than they were to have done in workspace apps in Gemini.
Next, Copilot’s code generation and integration was stronger than Google Gemini’s. When asked to generate a snippet that read a CSV file, 
Google Gemini’s code was unclear, too robust, and hard to follow. The comments strung throughout were hard to follow and unorganized. 
Copilot’s code snippet was much more concise- only measuring a few lines long in length- and was easier to integrate into an IDE like 
Visual Studio Code.  

In creating a to-do list, Microsoft’s Copilot also pulled ahead. Google Gemini’s to do list was empty, and all it did was create a 
titled list in google tasks- but it was unpopulated. Copilot, on the other hand, provided a clear template populated with items for 
todays to do list.  

As far as the blog posts go, both software's provided good writing. Gemini’s output was a little longer, but not by much, and the content was 
all about the same. That said, I felt this was one of the only examples that did not have a clearer stronger software.  

When creating a budget, Copilot generated a template that consisted of spending categories populated by variables specifying 
fund allocation. It did so without any more information than the request for the budget. Gemini, on the other hand, struggled with 
this prompt; it tried integrating the budget with Google Workspace without the user’s consent and therefore complicated the process 
by requiring more prompting to clarify.  

Lastly, both engines provided similar output in regard to image generation. 
When asked to provide an image of an owl, Copilot’s was a little more abstract than Gemini’s, but 
both provided solid output. This reaffirmed by belief that Copilot performs better in tasks requiring high factual accuracy, 
while Gemini performs well in creative and conversational tasks and sometimes struggles with factual accuracy.  

That said, my findings have shown Microsoft Copilot to be a better choice than Google Gemini. 
It provided better output for the same prompt in different contexts several times.
